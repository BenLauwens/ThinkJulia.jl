== The Goodies: Syntax

One of my goals for this book has been to teach you as little Julia as possible. When there were two ways to do something, I picked one and avoided mentioning the other. Or sometimes I put the second one into an exercise.

Now I want to go back for some of the good bits that got left behind. Julia provides a number of features that are not really necessary—you can write good code without them—but with them you can sometimes write code that’s more concise, readable or efficient, and sometimes all three.

This chapter and the next discuss the things I have left out in the previous chapters: 

* syntax supplements
* functions, types and macros directly available in +Base+
(((Base)))
* functions, types and macros in the Standard Library
(((Standard Library)))

=== Named Tuples

You can name the components of a tuple, creating a named tuple:

[source,@julia-repl-test]
----
julia> x = (a=1, b=1+1)
(a = 1, b = 2)
julia> x.a
1
----

With named tuples, fields can be accessed by name using dot syntax +(x.a)+.
(((named tuple)))(((dot syntax)))


=== Functions

Function in Julia can be defined by a compact syntax.

[source,@julia-repl-test]
----
julia> f(x,y) = x + y
f (generic function with 1 method)
----

[[anonymous_functions]]
==== Anonymous Functions

We can define a function without specifying a name:

[source,@julia-repl-test]
----
julia> x -> x^2 + 2x - 1
#1 (generic function with 1 method)
julia> function (x)
           x^2 + 2x - 1
       end
#3 (generic function with 1 method)
----

These are example of _anonymous functions_. Anonymous functions are often used as an argument to another function:
(((anonymous function)))(((Plots)))((("module", "Plots", see="Plots")))(((plot)))((("function", "Plots", "plot", see="plot")))

[source,jlcon]
----
julia> using Plots

julia> plot(x -> x^2 + 2x - 1, 0, 10, xlabel="x", ylabel="y")

----

<<fig19-1>> shows the output of the plotting command.

[[fig19-1]]
.Plot
image::images/fig191.svg[pdfwidth="10cm"]

==== Keyword Arguments

Function arguments can also be named:

[source,@julia-repl-test]
----
julia> function myplot(x, y; style="solid", width=1, color="black")
           ###
       end
myplot (generic function with 1 method)
julia> myplot(0:10, 0:10, style="dotted", color="blue")

----

_Keyword arguments_ in a function are specified after a semicolon in the signature but can be called with a comma.
(((;)))(((keyword arguments)))

==== Closures

A _closure_ is a technique allowing a function to capture a variable defined outside the calling scope of the function.

[source,@julia-repl-test]
----
julia> foo(x) = ()->x
foo (generic function with 1 method)

julia> bar = foo(1)
#1 (generic function with 1 method)

julia> bar()
1
----

In this example, the function +foo+ returns an anonymous function that has access to the +x+ argument of the function +foo+. +bar+ points to the anonymous function and returns the value of the argument of +foo+.


=== Blocks

A _block_ is a way to group a number of statements. A block starts with the keyword +begin+ and ends with +end+.
(((begin)))((("keyword", "begin", see="begin")))(((end)))(((block)))

In <<chap04>> the +@svg+ macro was introduced:

[source,julia]
----
🐢 = Turtle()
@svg begin
    forward(🐢, 100)
    turn(🐢, -90)
    forward(🐢, 100)
end
----

In this example, the macro +@svg+ has a single argument, i.e. a block grouping 3 function calls.

==== +let+ Blocks

A +let+ block is useful to create new bindings, i.e. locations that can refer to values.

[source,@julia-repl-test]
----
julia> x, y, z = -1, -1, -1;

julia> let x = 1, z
           @show x y z;
       end
x = 1
y = -1
ERROR: UndefVarError: z not defined
julia> @show x y z;
x = -1
y = -1
z = -1
----

In the example, the first +@show+ macro, shows the local +x+, the global +y+ and the undefined local +z+. The global variables are untouched.


==== +do+ Blocks

In <<reading_and_writing>> we had to close the file after when where done writing. This can be done automatically using a _do block_:
(((do)))((("keyword", "do", see="do")))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> data = "This here's the wattle,\nthe emblem of our land.\n"
"This here's the wattle,\nthe emblem of our land.\n"
julia> open("output.txt", "w") do fout
           write(fout, data)
       end
48
----

In this example +fout+ is the file stream used for output.

This is functionally equivalent to

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> f = fout -> begin
           write(fout, data)
       end
#3 (generic function with 1 method)
julia> open(f, "output.txt", "w")
48
----

The anonymous function is used as the first argument of the function +open+:
(((open)))

[source,julia]
----
function open(f::Function, args...)
    io = open(args...)
    try
        f(io)
    finally
        close(io)
    end
end
----

A +do+ block can “capture” variables from its enclosing scope. For example, the variable +data+ in the above example of +open pass:[...] do+ is captured from the outer scope.


=== Control Flow

==== Ternary Operator

The _ternary operator_, +?:+, is an alternative to an +if-elseif+ statement used when you need to make a choice between single expression values. 
(((?:)))((("operator", "Base", "?:", see="?:")))((("ternary operator", see="?:")))

[source,@julia-repl-test]
----
julia> a = 150
150
julia> a % 2 == 0 ? println("even") : println("odd")
even
----

The expression before the +?+ is a condition expression. If the condition is +true+, the expression before the +:+ is evaluated, otherwise, the expression after the +:+ is evaluated.

==== Short-Circuit Evaluation

The operators +&&+ and +||+ do a _short-circuit evaluation_: a next argument is only evaluated when it is needed to determine the final value.
(((&&)))(((||)))(((short-circuit evaluation)))

For example, a recursive factorial routine could be defined like this:
(((fact)))

[source,@julia-setup]
----
function fact(n::Integer)
    n >= 0 || error("n must be non-negative")
    n == 0 && return 1
    n * fact(n-1)
end
----

==== Tasks (aka Coroutines)

A _task_ is a control structure that can pass cooperatively control without returning. In Julia, a task can be implemented as a function having as first argument a +Channel+ object. A channel is used to pass values from the function to the callee.

The Fibonnaci sequence can be generated using a task.
(((task)))(((Channel)))((("type", "Base", "Channel", see="Channel")))(((put!)))((("function", "Base", "put!", see="put!")))

[source,@julia-setup chap19]
----
function fib(c::Channel)
    a = 0
    b = 1
    put!(c, a)
    while true
        put!(c, b)
        (a, b) = (b, a+b)
    end
end
----

+put!+ stores values in a channel object and +take!+ reads values from it:
(((take!)))((("function", "Base", "take!", see="take!")))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> fib_gen = Channel(fib);

julia> take!(fib_gen)
0
julia> take!(fib_gen)
1
julia> take!(fib_gen)
1
julia> take!(fib_gen)
2
julia> take!(fib_gen)
3
----

The constructor +Channel+ creates the task. The function +fib+ is suspended after each call to +put!+ and resumed after +take!+. For performance reasons, several values of the sequence are buffered in the channel object during a resume/suspend cycle.

A channel object can also be used as an iterator:

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> for val in Channel(fib)
           print(val, " ")
           val > 20 && break
       end
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21
----


=== Types

==== Primitive Types

A concrete type consisting of plain old bits is called a _primitive type_. Unlike most languages, with Julia you can declare your own primitive types. The standard primitive types are defined in the same way:
(((primitive type)))((("keyword", "primitive type", see="primitive type")))

[source,julia]
----
primitive type Float64 <: AbstractFloat 64 end
primitive type Bool <: Integer 8 end
primitive type Char <: AbstractChar 32 end
primitive type Int64 <: Signed 64 end
----

The number in the statements specifies how many bits are required.

The following example creates a primitive type +Byte+ and a constructor:
(((Byte)))((("type", "programmer-defined", "Byte", see="Byte")))

[source,@julia-repl-test]
----
julia> primitive type Byte 8 end

julia> Byte(val::UInt8) = reinterpret(Byte, val)
Byte
julia> b = Byte(0x01)
Byte(0x01)
----

The function +reinterpret+ is used to store the bits of an unsigned integer with 8 bits (+UInt8+) into the byte.
(((reinterpret)))((("function", "Base", "reinterpret", see="reinterpret")))(((UInt8)))((("type", "Base", "UInt8", see="UInt8")))

==== Parametric Types

Julia's type system is _parametric_, meaning that types can have parameters.

Type parameters are introduced after the name of the type, surrounded by curly braces:
(((curly braces)))

[source,@julia-setup chap19]
----
struct Point{T<:Real}
    x::T
    y::T
end
----

This defines a new parametric type, +Point{T<:Real}+, holding two "coordinates" of type +T+, which can be any type having +Real+ as supertype.

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> Point(0.0, 0.0)
Point{Float64}(0.0, 0.0)
----

In addition to composite types, abstract types and primitive types can also have a type parameter.

[TIP]
====
Having concrete types for struct fields is absolutely recommended for performance reasons, so this is a good way to make +Point+ both fast and flexible.
====

==== Type Unions

A _type union_ is an abstract parametric type that can act as any of its argument types:
(((type union)))(((Union)))((("type", "Base", "Union", see="Union")))

[source,@julia-repl-test]
----
julia> IntOrString = Union{Int64, String}
Union{Int64, String}
julia> 150 :: IntOrString
150
julia> "Julia" :: IntOrString
"Julia"
----

A type union is in most computer language an internal construct for reasoning about types. Julia however exposes this feature to its users because efficient code can be generated when the type union has a small number of types. This feature gives the Julia programmer a tremendous flexibility for controlling dispatch.

=== Methods

==== Parametric Methods

Method definitions can also have type parameters qualifying their signature:
(((signature)))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> isintpoint(p::Point{T}) where {T} = (T === Int64)
isintpoint (generic function with 1 method)
julia> p = Point(1, 2)
Point{Int64}(1, 2)
julia> isintpoint(p)
true
----

==== Function-like Objects

Any arbitrary Julia object can be made “callable”. Such “callable” objects are sometimes called _functors_.
(((functor)))

[source,@julia-setup chap19]
----
struct Polynomial{R}
    coeff::Vector{R}
end

function (p::Polynomial)(x)
    val = p.coeff[end]
    for coeff in p.coeff[end-1:-1:1]
        val = val * x + coeff
    end
    val
end
----

To evaluate the polynomial, we simply have to call it:

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> p = Polynomial([1,10,100])
Polynomial{Int64}([1, 10, 100])
julia> p(3)
931
----

=== Constructors

Parametric types can be explicitly or implicitly constructed:

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> Point(1,2)         # implicit T
Point{Int64}(1, 2)
julia> Point{Int64}(1, 2) # explicit T
Point{Int64}(1, 2)
julia> Point(1,2.5)       # implicit T
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching Point(::Int64, ::Float64)
----

Default inner and outer constructors are generated for each +T+:
(((constructor)))

[source,julia]
----
struct Point{T<:Real}
    x::T
    y::T
    Point{T}(x,y) where {T<:Real} = new(x,y)
end

Point(x::T, y::T) where {T<:Real} = Point{T}(x,y);
----

and both +x+ and +y+ have to be of the same type.

When +x+ and +y+ have a different type, the following outer constructor can be defined:

[source,@julia-setup chap19]
----
Point(x::Real, y::Real) = Point(promote(x,y)...);
----

The +promote+ function is detailed in <<promotion>>.
(((promote)))((("function", "Base", "promote", see="promote")))

=== Conversion and Promotion

Julia has a system for promoting arguments to a common type. This is not done automatically but can be easily extended.

==== Conversion

A value can be converted from one type to another:
(((conversion)))(((convert)))((("function", "Base", "convert", see="convert")))

[source,@julia-repl-test]
----
julia> x = 12
12
julia> typeof(x)
Int64
julia> convert(UInt8, x)
0x0c
julia> typeof(ans)
UInt8
----

We can add our own +convert+ methods:
[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> Base.convert(::Type{Point{T}}, x::Array{T, 1}) where {T<:Real} = Point(x...)

julia> convert(Point{Int64}, [1, 2])
Point{Int64}(1, 2)
----

[[promotion]]
==== Promotion

_Promotion_ is the conversion of values of mixed types to a single common type:
(((promotion)))(((promote)))

[source,@julia-repl-test]
----
julia> promote(1, 2.5, 3)
(1.0, 2.5, 3.0)
----

Methods for the +promote+ function are normally not directly defined, but the auxiliary function +promote_rule+ is used to specify the rules for promotion:
(((promote_rule)))((("function", "Base", "promote_rule", see="promote_rule")))

[source,julia]
----
promote_rule(::Type{Float64}, ::Type{Int32}) = Float64
----

=== Metaprogramming

Julia code can be represented as a data structure of the language itself. This allows a program to transform and generate its own code. 

==== Expressions

Every Julia program starts as a string:

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> prog = "1 + 2"
"1 + 2"
----

The next step is to parse each string into an object called an _expression_, represented by the Julia type +Expr+:
(((expression)))(((Expr)))((("type", "Base", "Expr", see="Expr")))(((parse)))((("function", "Meta", "parse", see="parse")))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> ex = Meta.parse(prog)
:(1 + 2)
julia> typeof(ex)
Expr
julia> dump(ex)
Expr
  head: Symbol call
  args: Array{Any}((3,))
    1: Symbol +
    2: Int64 1
    3: Int64 2
----

The +dump+ function displays expr objects with annotations.
(((dump)))

Expressions can be constructed directly by prefixing with +:+ inside parentheses or using a quote block
(((:)))(((quote)))((("keyword", "quote", see="quote")))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> ex = quote
           1 + 2
       end;
----

==== +eval+

Julia can evaluate an expression object using +eval+:
(((eval)))((("function", "Core", "eval", see="eval")))

[source,@julia-eval chap19]
----
import Base.eval
----

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> eval(ex)
3
----

Every module has its own +eval+ function that evaluates expressions in its scope.

[WARNING]
====
When you are using a lot of calls to the function +eval+, often this means that something is wrong. +eval+ is considered “evil”.
====

==== Macros

Macros can include generated code in a program. A _macro_ maps a tuple of +Expr+ objects directly to a compiled expression:
(((macro)))

Here is a simple macro:
(((@containervariable)))((("macro", "programmer-defined", "@containervariable", see="@containervariable")))

[source,@julia-setup chap19]
----
macro containervariable(container, element)
    return esc(:($(Symbol(container,element)) = $container[$element]))
end
----

Macros are called by prefixing their name with the +@+ (at-sign). The macro call +@containervariable letters 1+ is replaced by:
(((@)))

[source,julia]
----
:(letters1 = letters[1])
----

+@macroexpand @containervariable letters 1+  returns this expression which is extremely useful for debugging.
(((@macroexpand)))((("macro", "Base", "@macroexpand", see="@macroexpand")))

This example illustrates how a macro can access the name of its arguments, something a function can’t do. The return expression needs to be “escaped” with +esc+ because it has to be resolved in the macro call environment.
(((esc)))((("function", "Base", "esc", see="esc")))

[NOTE]
====
Why macros?

Macros generate and include fragments of customized code during parse time, thus _before_ the full program is run.
====

==== Generated Functions

The macro +@generated+ creates specialized code for methods depending on the types of the arguments:
(((generated functions)))(((@generated)))((("macro", "Base", "@generated", see="@generated")))

[source,@julia-setup chap19]
----
@generated function square(x)
    println(x)
    :(x * x)
end
----

The body returns a quoted expression like a macro.

For the caller, the _generated function_ behaves as a regular function:

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> x = square(2); # note: output is from println() statement in the body
Int64
julia> x              # now we print x
4
julia> y = square("spam");
String
julia> y
"spamspam"
----

=== Missing Values

_Missing values_ can be represented via the +missing+ object, which is the singleton instance of the type +Missing+.
(((missing values)))(((missing)))(((Missing)))((("type", "Base", "Missing", see="Missing")))

Arrays can contain missing values:

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> a = [1, missing]
2-element Array{Union{Missing, Int64},1}:
 1
  missing
----

The element type of such an array is +Union{Missing, T}+, with +T+ the type of the non-missing values.

Reduction functions return +missing+ when called on arrays which contain missing values

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> sum(a)
missing
----

In this situation, use the +skipmissing+ function to skip missing values:
(((skipmissing)))((("function", "Base", "skipmissing", see="skipmissing")))

[source,@julia-repl-test chap19]
----
julia> sum(skipmissing([1, missing]))
1
----


=== Calling C and Fortran Code

A lot of code is written in C or Fortran. Reusing tested code is often better than writing your own version of an algorithm. Julia can call directly existing C or Fortran libraries using the +ccall+ syntax.
(((ccall)))((("function", "Base", "ccall", see="ccall")))

In <<databases>> we introduced a Julia interface to the GDBM library of database functions. The library is written in C. To close the database a function call to +close(db)+ has to be made:

[source,julia]
----
Base.close(dbm::DBM) = gdbm_close(dbm.handle)

function gdbm_close(handle::Ptr{Cvoid})
    ccall((:gdbm_close, "libgdbm"), Cvoid, (Ptr{Cvoid},), handle)
end
----

A dbm object has a field +handle+ of +Ptr{Cvoid}+ type. This field holds a C pointer that refers to the database. To close the database the C function +gdbm_close+ has to be called having as only argument the C pointer pointing to the database and no return value. Julia does this directly with the +ccall+ function having as arguments:
(((Ptr)))((("type", "Base", "Ptr", see="Ptr")))

* a tuple consisting of a symbol holding the name of the function we want to call: +:gdbm_close+ and the shared library specified as a string: +"libgdm"+,

* the return type: +Cvoid+,

* a tuple of argument types: +(Ptr{Cvoid},)+ and

* the argument values: +handle+.

The complete mapping of the GDBM library can be found as an example in the ThinkJulia sources.
